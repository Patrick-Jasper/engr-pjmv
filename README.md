Welcome to the ReadMe for the Website of Engr. Patrick Jasper Villareal. Nothing much will be written here so sit back and enjoy!

The header of this website, which is my name in big bolding letters with a steel structure background, is the only part of the website using the percentage of the viewport (vh and vw) for measurements. I wanted to make sure that the first thing you see is this grand atrium of the website. The image is also using parallax not because of design principles, but because I think parallax backgrounds are cool.

The "About Me" section is as basic as they come. Due to time constraints, I stuck with my graduation picture with some description about myself. I added the link to my resume below to add some professional spice to it all.

The "Hobbies and Interests" section is also intended to be presented in a special way. I thought of doing a gallery with a text on the middle, but I am too busy and lazy to implement that. So I used parallax background (again). If you are wondering why the main title "Hobbies and Interests" is not centered. The reason is 'I don't know and I don't have enough time to debug this."

The only part of the site where you will find JavaScript is the button. The button will tell you n?ne (9) additional facts about myself, in random order. I intended both the text and the button to be centered in their respective containers. But because I angered the gods or something, I can't seem to manage to do it, so what you see is what you will get.

Here is the list of supposed alerts that you will receive when you press the special button:
- I have been in a school grand choir that appeared on a TV channel called 'TV Maria'
- I am an alumni member of UP Alliance of Gamers.
- My favorite wrestler is Jeff Hardy.
- In the past, I have practiced Taekwon-do.
- My family owns five Shih Tzus and two cats (idfk what their breed is).
- My favorite manga is 'Hitomi-chan wa Hito Mishiri' or 'Hitomi-chan Is Shy With Strangers'
- My favorite movie is both 'Moon' and 'Mr. Holmes'
- My favorite food is sisig with mayonnaise
- I have also had interests in video and audio editing, with my preferred editing software being the defunct Hitfilm Express.
